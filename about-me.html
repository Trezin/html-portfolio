<p>Hi, I'm Elena, a passionate web developer with a knack for creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly websites. With a strong foundation in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code. My work revolves around creating responsive, accessible, and visually appealing websites that not only look great but also provide seamless user experiences.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've honed my skills in various web development frameworks and tools, constantly staying updated with the latest trends and best practices in the industry. Whether it's building dynamic interfaces, optimizing website performance, or collaborating with designers and developers, I thrive on solving complex problems and pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web.</p>
<p>When I'm not coding, I love exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and continuously learning to expand my skill set. Outside of the tech world, you'll often find me tending to indoor plants, enjoying a good book, or exploring new coffee spots</p>
<p>I'm always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate with creative minds. Let's build something amazing together!</p>
